# WorldQuant University - Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision 🤖📸

Welcome to my journey through the **WorldQuant University's Applied AI Lab**! This repository documents my progress and showcases the exciting projects I'll be tackling in the realm of **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**.

## About the Applied AI Lab

This lab is an incredible opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of computer vision, a field where we teach machines to "see" and interpret images just like we do. 🧠

Offered by WorldQuant University, a leader in global education, the Applied AI Lab is designed to be **completely online and 100% free of cost**. This makes cutting-edge AI education accessible to anyone with a passion for learning.

The program focuses on **real-world applications**, providing a practical and impactful learning experience. Through **six hands-on projects**, we'll be exploring various aspects of computer vision, including:

- **Image Classification**:  Teaching computers to recognize different objects in images, just like identifying a cat from a dog in a picture. 🐶🐱
- **Object Detection**:  Locating and identifying multiple objects within an image. Imagine a self-driving car that can detect pedestrians, traffic lights, and other vehicles in real-time! 🚗🚦
- **Generative AI**:  Using AI to generate new images. This is the technology behind those impressive deepfakes and AI-generated art you've probably seen online. 🎨

## The Projects

Here's a glimpse of the exciting projects I'll be working on:

- [**Wildlife Image Classification 🦁🌏**](./P01_Widlife_Conservation_Ivory_Coast/): This project focuses on classifying wildlife images from camera traps, contributing to wildlife conservation efforts!
- [**Crop Disease Monitoring 🌿**](./P02_Crop_Disease_Uganda/): We'll build models to detect crop diseases, helping farmers protect their crops and improve food security.
- [**Traffic Flow Analysis 🚗**](./P03_Traffic_Monitoring_Bangladesh/): This project involves analyzing traffic patterns to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.
- [**Face Detection & Recognition 😊**](./P04_Celebrity_Sightings_India/): We'll explore facial recognition technology, understanding its applications and implications.
- [**Medical Image Generation 🏥**](./P05_Medical_Data_Spain/): Using AI to generate medical images, which can be valuable for research and diagnostics.
- [**Meme Generator App 😂**](./P06_Social_Media_Marketing_WQU):  Developing a fun meme generator app using stable diffusion models, demonstrating the creative potential of AI.

## More Skills

Throughout this lab, I'll be developing a comprehensive skillset in computer vision, including:

- **Understanding Neural Networks**: The foundation of deep learning, these powerful algorithms are inspired by the human brain.
- **Working with PyTorch & Transformers**: Utilizing industry-standard tools for building and training deep learning models.
- **Preparing Data for Machine Learning**: Learning how to clean and transform data to make it suitable for training AI models.
- **Building and Training Models**:  Developing, training, and evaluating various computer vision models for different tasks.
- **Model Deployment**: Taking trained models and making them accessible for real-world applications.
