# 🏥 Medical Image Generation with GANs  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
In this project, you'll explore **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic **medical images** like X-rays and MRIs. 🏥 You'll build a **custom GAN** from scratch and also use a **pre-trained GAN** to create realistic images. 🎨  

To make it interactive, you'll develop a **Streamlit web app** that allows users to generate medical images dynamically. 🌐 You'll also use **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration. 🗂️  

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- 🤖 **How to build and train a GAN from scratch**  
- 🖼️ **How to generate images using a pre-trained GAN**  
- 🏥 **How to train models with synthetic medical data**  
- 🌐 **How to build a web app using Streamlit**  
- 🗂️ **How to track and share code with Git & GitHub**

This project is a great way to explore **AI in healthcare** and build hands-on experience with GANs! 🚀✨
